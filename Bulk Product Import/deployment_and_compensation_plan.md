# CD Veira LTD Website Deployment and Compensation Plan

## Deployment Plan for Vercel with Custom Domain

### Step 1: Prepare the Codebase
1. Ensure all code is committed to the main branch of your Git repository
2. Run final tests locally to verify everything works as expected
3. Make sure all environment variables are documented for production setup

### Step 2: Create a Vercel Account
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com) and sign up for an account if you don't have one
2. Choose the free tier to start (can upgrade later based on traffic needs)
3. Connect your GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket account where the project is hosted

### Step 3: Import and Deploy the Project
1. From the Vercel dashboard, click "Add New" → "Project"
2. Select the CD Veira LTD repository from the list
3. Configure the project settings:
   - Framework preset: Next.js
   - Build command: `npm run build` (default)
   - Output directory: `.next` (default)
   - Environment variables: Add all required environment variables (MongoDB connection string, API keys, etc.)
4. Click "Deploy"

### Step 4: Set Up Custom Domain
1. Purchase a domain name from a registrar (e.g., GoDaddy, Namecheap, etc.) if not already owned
   - Recommended: `cdveira.com` or `cdveiraltd.com`
2. In the Vercel dashboard, go to your project settings
3. Navigate to "Domains" section
4. Add your custom domain
5. Follow Vercel's instructions to configure DNS settings at your domain registrar:
   - Option 1: Use Vercel nameservers (easiest)
   - Option 2: Add specific DNS records (CNAME, A records)
6. Wait for DNS propagation (can take up to 48 hours, but often much faster)

### Step 5: Configure SSL Certificate
1. Vercel automatically provisions SSL certificates for custom domains
2. Verify that HTTPS is working correctly by visiting your domain

### Step 6: Post-Deployment Verification
1. Test all critical user flows on the live site
2. Verify that all images and assets are loading correctly
3. Check mobile responsiveness
4. Test payment processing in production mode
5. Verify that analytics are properly tracking

### Step 7: Set Up Monitoring and Analytics
1. Connect Google Analytics or similar service
2. Set up uptime monitoring (Vercel provides basic monitoring)
3. Configure error tracking with a service like Sentry
